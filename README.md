# Whale Off the Port(folio)

## Context

Harold's company has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best.

Here I create a quantitative analysis tool to Harold help him determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

This tool analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. You will be given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 
This analysis create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market ([S&P 500 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/TSX_60)).
